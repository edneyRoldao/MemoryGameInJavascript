# MemoryGameInJavascript

Hello everyone !!!

My family likes US tv shows, so I decide to create a simple web project written in Javascript, CSS3, HTML5, JQuery and Bootstrap.
This project is a fun thematic memory game. It will developed by my Daughter and I.

The first theme will Game of Thrones. 

21/12/15 - Finally the core of project is implemented, but to see it you must access the branch EdneyInSAGE.

Have Fun !
